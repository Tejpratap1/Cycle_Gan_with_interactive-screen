# CycleGAN in PyTorch
## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started
### Installation

cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)
Download a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.

- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo
```
- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained
```
- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset's A to B direction is photos to labels.

- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).
